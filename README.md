## I'm Jake ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a dedicated tech enthusiast and professional with a passion for turning ideas into reality through fast, responsive, and accessible experiences. My journey into technology began in the '90s, inspired by my dad, a seasoned programmer, who introduced me to coding and gaming at a young age. My first dive into the tech world was playing Wolfenstein on his PC at age 5, and that moment sparked a lifelong fascination with technology. Since then, my love for the internet has fueled my drive to learn, create, and develop.
